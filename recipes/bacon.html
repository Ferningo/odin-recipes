    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Bacon is a type of salt-cured pork made from various cuts, typically the belly or less fatty parts of the back.
        It is eaten as a side dish (particularly in breakfasts), used as a central ingredient (e.g., the bacon, lettuce,
        and tomato sandwich (BLT)), or as a flavouring or accent (as in bacon bits in a salad).
    </p>
    <p>
        Before the advent of cheap and widespread artificial refrigeration in the modern era, the curing of meat was
        necessary for its safe long-term preservation. However, both the flavour imparted to the meat in doing so and
        the extended shelf life it offered had become much prized, and although curing is in general no longer necessary
        in the developed world, it continues in wide use.
