    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These fried shrimp are jumbo shrimp coated in seasoned breadcrumbs, then deep fried to golden brown perfection.
        The perfect main course or appetizer option that's even better than what you'd get at a restaurant!

        I happen to be a shrimp lover; whether it's shrimp pasta, shrimp fried rice, or these delightfully crunchy fried
        shrimp. This is a must-try recipe if you have seafood lovers in your life!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound medium shrimp, peeled (tails left on) and deveined</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1 cup panko crumbs</li>
        <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place shrimp in a bowl and season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Mix flour and paprika together in a
            shallow bowl. Place eggs in a second bowl and panko in a third bowl. </li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or deep skillet to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). </li>
        <li>Dip each shrimp into flour mixture, then into egg, and finally into panko crumbs to coat. </li>
        <li>Fry a few shrimp at a time in the hot oil until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon
            and drain on paper towels before serving. </li>
    </ol>
