        <li>1 (16 ounce) package pasta</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped onion</li>

    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in pasta and return to a boil.

            and transfer into a large bowl. </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat oil in a frying pan over medium-low heat. Add onion; cook and stir until softened, about 3

        <li>Add pesto mixture to hot pasta; stir in grated cheese and toss well to coat. </li>
